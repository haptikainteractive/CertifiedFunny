                            Donald Glover is a lucky man, and he says so himself. After Tina Fey hired him right out of college to be a writer for 30 Rock, he was cast as dim-bulb jock Troy in NBC’s latest hit comedy, Community, and now he’s debuting his first half-hour stand-up special March 19 on Comedy Central. But his rapid ascent through the comedy ranks is more than just luck. He’s a prolific entertainer, juggling his acting and stand-up with writing and performing duties for the sketch team Derrick Comedy. He also produces and releases albums under the name Childish Gambino. But while his success could be attributed to many things—luck, talent, ambition—for Glover it all seems to boil down to being a nerdy obsessive. He recently spoke to The A.V. Club about why nerds are achievers, how he figures out whether something is funny, and what it was like pursuing stand-up even though it meant leaving a job where he "pooped Emmys".

                        <p class="text_news">
                            The A.V. Club: Right after it was announced that Community got picked up for a second season, Dan Harmon posted a video on Twitter of himself trying to trick the cast into thinking it had been cancelled. Did you believe him at the time, or were you on to him?
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_news">
                            Donald Glover: I was kind of on to it. I was like, “They just added three episodes. If they were canceling us, that would make no sense.” It was the day we came back from the Olympics, and our ratings were the highest they’ve been, with no promotions, so I was like, “That seems a little crazy.” But then I was like, “Well, NBC hasn’t been doing the sanest things lately.” So I was a little concerned, but once Dan started getting into it—at the beginning of the tape, when he’s like, “It’s not canceled, but…” I was like, “Okay, that’s a good way of going into it, if we got picked up,” so I was fine. But I was enjoying Yvette [Nicole Brown], because Yvette is always thinking we’re canceled. She’s like, “Oh we got fries to eat today, does that mean we’re canceled? Does that mean we’re not good enough for potato chips? What does that mean?”
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_news">
                            AVC: So when you left 30 Rock to do Community—
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_news">
                            DG: Actually, a lot of people think that. People think I was on 30 Rock and I got offered Community and I left. I had left 30 Rock already. Now looking back, I’m like, “That was stupid.” It’s funny. I was like, “I’m gonna do stand-up.” [Laughs.] Leave this great job where I poop Emmys and go do stand-up, because I had fallen in love with stand-up, and I was like, “I’m gonna do this. I love it. I’m going to work it every night and do stand-up.” But then I auditioned for this thing that they asked me to do, and I happened to get it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_news">
                            AVC: Did people think you were insane for leaving 30 Rock?
                        </p>
                        <p class="text_news">
                            DG: Yeah definitely. My mom more so than anyone. My mom was livid. I mean, she wasn’t going to kill me, but she was—no, I’ll take that back. She was. She didn’t get it. She’d come to visit me before and said, “Okay, he’s not starving. He lives in an apartment. He’s not on the street. I don’t get what he’s doing. I assume he’s writing Tracy’s [Morgan] words, but at least he’s taken care of.” And then I was like, “I’m leaving,” and before that, I had planned on moving to L.A. too, so she was really like, “I don’t get it. What are you doing?” People, I’m sure, were like, “Why are you leaving?” But then this Community thing came up and it kind of eased the pain, I think.
